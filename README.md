# Data-Visualization
  <br /> - This app uses [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and the [U.S Airbnb Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritikseth/us-airbnb-open-data) dataset.
 <br />  - To see the full code check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mansi-3006/Data-Visualization).
 <br />       - Since its inception in 2008, Airbnb has disrupted the traditional hospitality industry as more travellers decide to use Airbnb as their primary means of accommodation. Airbnb offers travellers a more unique and personalized way of accommodation and experience.
  <br />      - This dataset has one file- AB_US_2020.csv which has columns describing features such as host id, hostname, listing id, listing name, latitude and longitude of listing, the neighbourhood, price, room type, minimum number of nights, number of reviews, last review date, reviews per month, availability, host listings and city.
  <br />      - This dataset is a compilation of multiple datasets found on Inside Airbnb.
